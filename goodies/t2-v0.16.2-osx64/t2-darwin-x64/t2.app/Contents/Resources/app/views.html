  <div id="basic-view-explanation">
    The Basic view collects together the most important metrics for
    assessing the overall health of a node or cluster. It can serve as
    a useful starting point for constructing a custom view to diagnose
    an issue.

    The Memory view shows metrics useful for diagnosing memory
    consumption issues. The figure shows how memory is
    organized. Indicators of problems include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Large resident memory relative to avaiable physical memory;
        generally this will be a result of one of the following
        issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        A server crash (diagnosed by uptime returning to 0 and no
        indication of graceful shutdown in the mongod log) in
        conjunction with an increase of resident memory is often the
        result mongod being terminated by the OOM (out-of-memory)
        killer on Linux.
      <li>
        A large amount of allocated memory outside of the WT cache
        ("allocated minus wt cache"). Generally mongod aims to bound
        memory allocated outside the cache; if this is not the case
        further investigation to determine the cause is needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the heap size ("heap_size") is larger than expected and
        this is accounted for by a large amount of free memory in the
        heap ("total free") but the allocated memory
        ("current_allocated_bytes") has never been large enough to
        account for the heap size, there may be a memory fragmentation
        issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        WT cache size should remain bounded by the configured maximum.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The following are not necessarily an indicator of a problem per se:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Large virtual memory: a substantial portion of virtual memory
        may be non-resident and therefore not consuming available
        physical memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        A large amount of virtual memory not used by the heap
        ("virtual minus heap"). Typically this is virtual memory
        reserved for stacks, and can be large if there are a large
        number of connections; however generally only a small portion
        of this is resident.
      </li>

  <div id="bottlenecks-view-explanation">
    Bottlenecks are places in the system where parallel operations may
    queue waiting for some resource. Contended resources include CPU,
    disk, and access to data structures. The magnitude of a bottleneck
    is indicated by queue length or count of active operations, so it
    is a dimensionless number. This is reported in one of the
    following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Directly as a queue length, for example active
        readers/writers, processes (threads) running/blocked, disk
        queue length, WT transactions out.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a utilization percentage, which is essentially queue length
        truncated at 1; that is, a utilization of 100% corresponds to
        a queue length â‰¥1.
      </li>
      <li>
        As an accumulation of time spent waiting for a resource, such
        as a lock.  This is typically recorded as cumulative
        microseconds spent waiting across all threads; by calculating
        a rate from this and scaling by one million, we can infer the
        average number of threads waiting on that resource at any
        given time, so this metric is presented with units of
        "threads".
      </li>
    </ul>
    To diagnose the cause of a bottleneck, consider the order in which
    any given operation encounters the potential bottlenecks. If a
    bottleneck is evident at one point in this sequence but not at the
    next, then the problem must be between the upstream and downstream
    points
  </div>

  <div id="colocation-view-explanation">
    This view helps identify whether colocated data and journal files
    are creating a bottleneck during checkpoints.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Check the last phase of a checkpoint ("checkpoint currently
        running"). During this phase the checkpoint calls fsync to
        ensure durability of the checkpoint so we see more "active
        filesystem fsync calls" (which includes both checkpoint
        and journal I/O).
      </li>
      <li>
        Higher "log sync time" indicates that I/O is slowing the
        journaling process and disk I/O ("average utilization" and
        "average queue length") should show the disk is over-utilized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, "active slot closed" metrics mean that slow
        journaling is stalling MongoDB operations during checkpoints.
      </li>
    </ul>
